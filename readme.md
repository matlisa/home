# Welcome!
This project combines Material Design guidance, documentation and templates. Using Glitch as a code editing platform, this is a fully customizable project so anyone can learn and build with Material Design.

## 1. Click 'Show' and then 'Next to The Code' above, to set up your workspace

## 2. Use the 'my-theme.scss' file to change values for Typography, Shape and Color Activities 
To complete the Typography, Shape and Color activity, you’ll modify the variables in your project’s ```my-theme.scss``` file. By default, each theme starts off with Material’s baseline values. We’ve added these values in the theme so you can easily swap them out.

## 3. Use the 'my-components.scss' file to change values for the Layout Activity
To complete the Layout activity, you’ll modify the variables in your project’s ```my-components.scss``` file. For this lesson, we have only included the component used in the Layout activity, Image List, but can also be used to customize other components. 

## 4. Put your name on it! Use the 'my-theme.js' file to add a name to your project
Write your name in between the empty apostrophes in ```const themeName = '';```

#### Copy the code to build with your new Material Theme 
You now have own Material theme that you can use in your [Material Components for the web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) projects. 


We’ve made it easy to visualize your theme with our [Build a Material Theme](https://glitch.com/~material-starter-kit) project, just copy your theming variables from ```my-theme.scss``` into the Theme Builder's ```my-theme.scss``` and start building.

*Built with [Material Starter Kit](https://glitch.com/~material-starter-kit) a file template to get you up and running with Material Components for the Web. Remix it and start theming.*
